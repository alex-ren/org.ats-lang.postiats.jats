Assertion: main() |= G sys_assertion
********Verification Result********
The Assertion (main() |= G sys_assertion) is NOT valid.
A counterexample is presented as follows.
<init -> main_init -> τ -> τ -> sys_ch_sch.1.1.3 -> τ -> thread_init -> [if((1 == 1))] -> τ -> τ -> [if!(sys_gstack.frame_get_bool(1, 0, 1))] -> τ -> τ -> [if!(sys_gstack.frame_get_bool(1, 0, 1))] -> τ -> τ -> [if(sys_gstack.frame_get_bool(1, 0, 1))] -> τ -> τ -> τ -> τ -> thread_finalize -> τ -> τ>
